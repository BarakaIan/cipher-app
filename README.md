Its an application that encrypts and decrypts data by entering a key.

The App Caesar Cipher Encoder is mainly about encrypting a text that's been given by the user and returning its encryption according to a certain key also given by the user which indicates the number of shifts in between the alphabets. The key just defines the number of shifts made by a character in order to return its encryption. i.e: e with a right shift of 2 will be g in cipher
